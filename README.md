# Self Driving Car Simulation
A project built using HTML5,CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript.<br><br>
The project demonstrates a visualization of a neural network that has been embedded into an automated self driving car.<br><br>
The car takes its decisions with the help of the neural network which has been trained and learned under various conditions.<br><br>
The project is scalable enabling developers to further enhance the neural design and test various conditions on the nueral network.<br><br>
